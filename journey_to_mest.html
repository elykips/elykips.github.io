               <h2>My journey to Mest</h2>
                <p>
                    
                    Several weeks of personal reflection had elapsed after final interviews with the MEST
                     Entrepreneurs In Training  program for 2018 
                    and I was becoming a worried man. Reasons: the suspense was killing me from the inside. 
                    I so badly needed to know whether or not i was going to have a date with greatness at MEST. 
                    Every minute, i found myself refreshing my mails anticipating for an email from Amma Bafoe, 
                    the MEST Recruitment and Marketing Lead.
                    A couple of days later, in one of my boring afternoon, i received an email alert on my phone but 
                    was hesitant to check it out since i had issues with my boss that morning after skipping a team building meeting.
                    An email that could break or make me,  "MEST Application Final Feedback"  hit my face when i finally got to my mails.
                    I held my breath and tried to compose myself in order to come to terms with the outcome. 
                    I had made it to the Meltwter Entrepreneurial School of Technology, EIT 2018 program! I was so excited 
                    and could hardly conceal my happiness.  A ray of hope finally rekindled after missing the program in the previous year.
                    I got determined to do my best in the program now that i had gotten a one-in-a-lifetime opportunity 
                    to tremendously change my career life.
